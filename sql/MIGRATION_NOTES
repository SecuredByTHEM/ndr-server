Migrations are handled by flyway to make things simple and easier. Objects that
don't retain data such as views, and functions should be repeatable so the canonical
definition can always be stored as a file.

However, one hiccup exists. Flyway runs repeatable migrations in description order.
Because stored procedures can require that a view requires due to postgresql typing
system, views should always be ordered in the way they go into the system. There's
probably more we need to do here, but this is a start for now
