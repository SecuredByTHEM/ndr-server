This directory has the files required to generate a SSL root certificate
acceptable for use for testing and and enrolling your own server clients.

This code expects CloudFlare SSL (https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) to be
installed. An OCSP server *must* be available for testing purposes off the
intermidate certificate

Read the json files to set the certificate fields. By default this will
generate all the root certificates, and an intermediate certificate for
each one. If you need to issue a second intermediate, read the CFSSL
documentation
